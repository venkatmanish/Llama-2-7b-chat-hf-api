LLAMA Chat
LLAMA Chat Server is a Flask-based web application that serves as an interface to a conversational AI model for generating text based on user prompts. The server utilizes the Hugging Face Transformers library to interact with a pre-trained language model.

Features
Text Generation: Users can input prompts via a web interface, and the server will generate text based on those prompts using a pre-trained language model.
Error Handling: The server handles errors gracefully and provides informative messages to users in case of any issues.
Logging: Logging functionality is implemented to record incoming prompts and generated text, as well as any errors that occur during the process.
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Flask
Hugging Face Transformers
PyTorch (if using GPU)

Setup and Usage
1.Clone this repository to your local machine:
'''
git clone https://github.com/your-username/llama-chat-server.git
'''
2.Install the required dependencies:
'''
pip install -r requirements.txt
'''
3.Start the Flask server:
'''
python server.py
'''
4.Access the web interface by opening your browser and navigating to http://localhost:5000. You should see a form where you can input a prompt and generate text.

Configuration
llama_server.log: This file contains logs of incoming prompts, generated text, and any errors encountered during the process. You can configure logging settings in server.py.
Example CURL Request
You can also generate text using cURL from the command line. Here's an example:
'''
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"prompt": "Write a code for amstrong number", "max_length": 256}' http://localhost:5000/generate
'''
In this example, the server will generate text based on the prompt "Write a code for amstrong number" with a maximum token length of 256.
